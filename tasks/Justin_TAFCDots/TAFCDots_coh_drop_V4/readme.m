% TAC_Gold_final_V2 contains static dots (i.e. frozen dots) which resets
% the true direction of the dots (the direction before the static dots has
% no relationship to the direction after, the direction is resampled)

% TAC_Gold_final_V3 contains static dots that overlaps with the true
% direction. In other words, the true direction is not reset by the
% presence of the static dots and the true direction remains controlled by
% the frame by frame hazard rate.
